Erlangville Cycle Hire
======================

The mayor of Erlangville wants to offer his citizens a new service: a Cycle Hire scheme.
Spread across the City of Erlangville are a number of docking stations. Each docking station
consists of a terminal and N docking points where you pick up (i.e. release) and return (i.e.
secure) cycles. You take a cycle from a docking station, ride it where you like, then return it
into any other docking station, ready for the next person.
Youâ€™ve been asked to implement a prototype which models the Cycle Hire system. You will
do that in Erlang.

----------------------------------------------------

A docking station consists of a terminal and N docking points where you pick up and return
cycles. Two separate docking stations can have a different number of docking points.
